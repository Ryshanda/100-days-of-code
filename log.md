### Day 2: December 31, 2018 )


**Today's Progress**: Did the flexbox froggy game. It was a great learning exercise. Tried to solve a robot animation problem. My code was jacked up but it worked. I have to learn best practices for code. I want my code to be neat and done in the best way.

**Thoughts:** In the process of coding a mock landing page for my course. I don't know how to upload the file in progress. I have to do more GitHub research to figure that out.
